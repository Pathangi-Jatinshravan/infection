##Khan Academy Limited Infection Interview

The task: Ideally we would like every user in any given classroom to be using the same version of the site. Enter “infections”. We can use the heuristic that each teacher-student pair should be on the same version of the site. So if A coaches B and we want to give A a new feature, then B should also get the new feature. Note that infections are transitive - if B coaches C, then C should get the new feature as well. Also, infections are transferred by both the “coaches” and “is coached by” relations.

First, model users (one attribute of a user is the version of the site they see) and the coaching relations between them. A user can coach any number of other users. You don’t need to worry about handling self-coaching relationships.

Now implement the infection algorithm. Starting from any given user, the entire connected component of the coaching graph containing that user should become infected.
